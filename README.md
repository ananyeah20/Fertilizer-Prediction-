# FERTILIZER PREDICTION
## Machine learning in python
### ABSTRACT
Fertilizers play an important role in the field of agriculture. 
The common difficulty present among the Indian farmers 
are that they don’t opt for the proper soil based on their 
crop necessities. Because of this, productivity is affected. 
This problem of the farmers has been solved through 
precision agriculture. There are several fertilizers with 
varied ratio of NPK depending on the optimum quantity of 
nutrients to make a fertile soil which in turn produces a 
good yield. Each type of soil can have different kinds of 
features and different kinds of crops can grow on different 
types of soils. We need to know the optimum conditions 
for various crops to analyze which fertilizer suits the best 
for the type of crop growing in that particular soil. 
Machine Learning comes helpful in this case. We test and 
train the dataset to predict the accuracy and precision of 
the parameters given in the dataset

### Project Components
1. Data collection
2. Data visualization
3. Data cleaning
4. Machine Learning- Random forest Classifier

### Data Collection

The dataset containing the soil specific attributes 
which are collected from a website “Kaggle”, 
collected by researching various websites and 
sources.

The dataset can be referred in the attachement.

The attributes considered where temperature, humidity, moisture, NPK values, 
soil type, crop type and fertilizer name. The above 
stated parameters of soil play a major role in the 
crop's ability to absorb nutrients and fertilizers from 
the soil. For a good yield, the soil must provide 
acceptable environment for it. Soil is the anchor of 
the roots. The moisture holding capacity determines 
the crop ability to absorb nutrients primarily 
nitrogen, potassium, phosphorus. Texture, i.e. the 
soil type determines how porous the soil is and the 
comfort of air and water movement which is 
essential to prevent the plants from becoming 
waterlogged. The level of acidity or alkalinity (Ph) 
is a master variable which affects the availability of 
soil nutrients. The activity of microorganisms 
present in the soil and also the level of exchangeable 
aluminum can be affected by PH.
